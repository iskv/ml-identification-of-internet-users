# ml_project
The project is a portfolio on the topic of Machine Learning.

This project solved the problem of identifying the user by the sequence of sites visited by them. In parts 1-4 of this project, the optimal method for solving the problem was selected. In the 5th part of the project, the conclusions made in parts 1-4 were used in the competition Kaggle: "Catch Me If You Can", which allowed us to achieve a high degree of confidence in the predictions of the algorithm. In part 6, using data from the Kaggle competition: "Identify Me If You Can", the advantages of using the Vowpal Wabbit library for online classification on large samples with a large number of classes were demonstrated, namely, the speed of the algorithm and low consumption of computer resources.
